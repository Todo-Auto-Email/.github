# Todo Mailer

## The Problem
We (the developers) ended up registering in a few overlapping hackthons, which made it difficult to keep track of deadlines, and also to assign
priority to work.

## Solution
1. An automated web application to send emails to users listing the upcoming events they have registered for. 
2. Log in, create events, subscribe/ unsubscribe, get emails 2 times a day.
3. The events in the email are sorted in ascending order of their deadlines, so that the most urgent events are shown on the top.
4. All events from multiple websites appear in a single place, removing the problem of looking up multiple websites to check for deadlines.
5. Show ETA along with deadline for easier estimation of time left.
